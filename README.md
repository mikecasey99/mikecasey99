# 👋 Hi, I'm Mike

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer focused on building modern enterprise applications using **C# and .NET Core**. I'm currently preparing for a career in government or enterprise tech, and actively leveling up my skills in backend development, clean code practices, and dependency injection.

I am really eager to expand my knowledge and want to continue learning more about **.NET Core**, **Entity Framework**, and **Angular.**
